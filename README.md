# MAAI_CW1
This is a project to test various bidding strategies in order to maximise the number of clicks on a given dataset. 
We build linear and ORTB learning models that utilise various features of ads in training dataset,to predict a click through rate and use that as the base of a bidding strategy. 
We also explore more heuristic random interval bidding and use a mix of strategies to compete in a multi-agent competition
for ad clicks involving 29 other groups.
